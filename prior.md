# *Relationship between mood and music* 

<p>Researchers at Deezer worked on mood classification of music using hybrid techniques [1a]. The dataset they construct is an integral part of our project, as it 
gives context to the latent emotional space inhabited by music.</p>

<p>Hu et. al wrote about lyric text mining in music mood classification [2a], citing a "ceiling" to the mood classification that could be done just with frequency 
analysis. They also discuss the difficulties of creating ground truth datasets and go through considerable efforts to create their own. They distinguish between 
18 moods, much more granularity than in our project, and open us up to just how finely emotions can be discriminated when using text semantic analysis.<p>
